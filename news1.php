					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>Welcome to patch 5.4 - the one where we follow up on patch 5.2 with some mage love. Up front: the new +120 AP item is currently slated for a future patch (soon(tm)), but this hasn't stopped us from working on the few mages that needed help in a post-DFG world. Actually, like we mentioned in the patch 5.2 foreword, the impact of DFG's removal hasn't been all that noticeable in champion performance, but there were two we knew would have identity crises (that's the plural) in the aftermath: Mordekaiser and Veigar.</p>

				<h2>Mixed nationality teams struggle</h2>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>North America is learning what China discovered a month ago -- adding Koreans does not instantly make a better team. </p>
						<p>While many of the primarily Chinese teams have continued to dominate the region, the mixed nationality teams are still trying to fix their synergy problems. Internationally, Fnatic seems to be the exception to this rule, with both ReignOver and Huni preforming in each of their four games.</p>
