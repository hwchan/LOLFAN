					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>The celestial vagabond known only as Bard, the Wandering Caretaker, dwells beyond the physical universe in realms unknown to man. Manifesting when others threaten the cosmic equilibrium, the ancient caretaker acts with speed and intent, only returning to his endless watch once he has steered Runeterra from catastrophe. He is unique from all other champions, and has all new abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. If you feel bold, try him out and go out of your comfort zone.</p>

				<h2>Upcoming Refer-a-Friend downtime</h2>
				<img alt="News page" class = "col-md-6" src="images/News9.jpg">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>We recently shared our plans to update the Refer-a-Friend program to better serve players bringing allies into League of Legends. We’ll be taking the current RAF program down for the transition. The downtime may last a few days, during which time we’ll transfer players to the new program, including handing out any new rewards earned as a result of previous referrals. </p>
						<p>We’re excited to launch the update to the Refer-a-Friend program—thanks for your patience as we implement all of the changes!</p>
